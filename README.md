# unity-game-stickman
### Summary
This is my initial attempt at making a 2D top-down perspective (2.5D) video game, which I am simply calling Stickman Game for now. \
The current version is changeset 58, originally developed using Unity's Version Source Control. 

### Current Features
I used this project to familiarize myself with implementing various mechanics in Unity, including:
  - Event-Driven architecture, with various synchronous and asynchronous event channels
  - A combat system with mele and ranged abilities
  - Items, including weapons with varying damage and durability, potions, and miscellaneous quest items
  - Player inventory and UI
  - Passive and aggressive mobs with loot tables
  - NPCs
  - Quest system
  - Settings menu with persistent player preferences for keybinds and audio volume
  - Save system, including manual and automatic saves, and the ability to load a previous save (unfinished)


### Future Features
The following are the mechanics I plan to add in the future:
  - Finish the save and load system
  - Allow the player to sell items at the shop (currently, the player can only purchase items)
  - Player death and respawn mechanics
  - Add "trainers" which allow the player to learn new combat abilities
  - Custom dialogue system to replace the current prebuilt dialogue plugin
  - Refine existing mechanics (combat, quest system, mob prefabs)


### Plugins/Assets
This project uses the following external plugins/assets:
  - OdinInspector from Sirenix
  - Thaleah Pixel Font
  - Dialogue System by Pixel Crushers

All pixel art assets were either made by myself (unfortunately, I'm not much of an artist...), free assets from the internet, or made by my friend, Arielle.
